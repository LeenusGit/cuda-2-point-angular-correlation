# 2-point Angular Correlation

A CUDA program written to solve the task in GPU programming at Ã…bo Akademi University. The task is to compute three histograms (DD, RR, DR) of the  2-point angular correlation function for two sets of galaxies

- D: measured set of 100 000 galaxies D
- R: synthetic random evenly distributed set of 100 000 galaxies

In total $3 * 10^{10}$ angles.

## Requirements

- CMAKE
- nvidia-cuda-toolkit
- GCC 8 (or older) OR Clang-8
- CUDA enabled graphics card

## Compiling

Create a build folder in the project root and cd there.

`mkdir ./build && cd $_`

Initialize CMake in the build folder. We used compute capability 7.0 and the clang-8 compiler. 

`cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS="-arch=sm_70 -ccbin clang-8" ..`

Build the program using the makefile generated by CMake in the build folder 

`make`

Execute the binary *angcorr* built in the project root.

`../angcorr`

When no parameters are given, the program will look for the input files in `./data/`

The result histograms will be written to `./result/`
